# The activities controller handles all actions related to enrollment for
# activities by users.
# The various methods in this controller directly manipulate Participants, a
# many-to-many association on Members, and changes made will be visible in the
# admin view. Note that the :id parameters here correspond to Activity ids, and
# not Participant ids, as this makes linking to the enrollment page for a
# single activity possible.
