# API documentation
Koala has an API endpoint for a few applications; radio, _zuil_, and checkout, but there are many more possibilities. This documentation describes the possible routes and responses divided in; [members](#members), [groups](#groups), [activities](#activities), [participants](#participants), and [checkout](#checkout).

## Members

## Groups

## Activities
Activities are used by radio and the _zuil_ and radio also shows commercials of companies. These routes are publically available, however authenticating with the `activity-read` rights gives you more information about the activities.

##### Retrieve activities with posters

## Participant


## Checkout
All checkout endpoints require a secret called `token` declared in the configuration of [.rbenv-vars](/.rbenv-vars-sample). A generic response because of this would be a forbidden response meaning that the secret does not correspond with the secret of koala.
```json
HTTP/1.1 403 FORBIDDEN
Content-Type → application/json; charset=utf-8
```
Below are the endpoints that can be used for checkout.
