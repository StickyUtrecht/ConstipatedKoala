# Operation Constipated Koala

## Dev setup

You will need a working package manager, and a working ruby version manager and/or
build tools.

### External dependencies

Install before continuing:

 - `ruby-2.1.2` (install with [`rbenv install`][rbenv] or, if you must, [`rvm`][rvm]);
 - MySQL with database created.

  [rbenv]: https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv
  [rvm]: http://rvm.io/

### Running the Rails app

This is how you can get started with the development setup.

```shell
# Clone and switch directories:
$ git clone git@github.com:StickyUtrecht/ConstipatedKoala.git && cd ConstipatedKoala

# Install ruby dependencies:
$ bundle install

# Create `config/database.yml` with adapter `mysql2` and database credentials
$ mvim config/database.yml

# Populate the database
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate && bundle exec rake db:seed

# Run the server
$ bundle exec rails server

# Add dev host to hosts file
$ echo "127.0.0.1 koala.rails.dev intro.rails.dev" >> /etc/hosts
```

All done! Now you have the admin system and intro website running at:

 - [`http://koala.rails.dev:3000`](http://koala.rails.dev:3000)
 - [`http://intro.rails.dev:3000`](http://intro.rails.dev:3000)
